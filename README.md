## Business Portfolio Review System  

The Business Portfolio Review System is a rule-based system using Fuzzy JESS. The system is designed to help its users determine if their current financial profile, aka business portfolio, is strong enough to help them establish their own private business. The system performs a brief analysis of the current situation of the user by asking a few questions, generates a portfolio and then examines the various factors of the user’s portfolio to determine whether he/she is financially sound to start a business venture. The system also highlights some of the reasons behind its final decision/prediction and may provide some suggestions to the user in order to overcome his/her shortcomings.
